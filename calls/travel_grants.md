The State of the Map Organizing Committee provides a Travel Grant Programme (TGP) to facilitate accessibility and diversity at the global SotM 2024 Conference, which will happen in Nairobi, Kenya, September 6-8. This will be the first in-person OSM global event held in Africa. Also, while the pandemic is slowing down, we are concerned about health regulations and the increased cost of travelling. Given the circumstances, the programme will also dedicate a portion of the budget available to support remote attendance (e.g. by providing access to a reliable internet connection) for those who cannot travel to Kenya because of imposed restrictions, travel costs, or other reasons.

The call for applications to the Travel Grant Programme will be open until January 31, 2024, at 23:59 UTC.

<strong>It is fundamental to read all the information on this page before submitting an application.</strong>

<h2 id="for-applicants">For applicants</h2>

This section sets out the benefits of a Travel Grant to attend SotM 2024 and the process and criteria by which applicants will be selected. The TGP is administered by the State of the Map Organizing Committee.

### Travel Grants

The Travel Grant will include a full conference ticket and a lump-sum contribution towards travel, accommodation and other expenses.

There will be five (5) different sizes of travel grants available:

| Grant Size | Likely Used For | Expected number of winners |
| ---------- | --------------- | -------------------------- |
| 100 €      | Applicants from Kenya | 8 |
| 250 €      | Applicants from Tanzania and Uganda | 7 |
| 800 €      | Applicants from other African countries | 8 |
| 900 €      | Applicants from other countries classified as High-income economies or lower based on World Bank country rating by income | 5 |
| 1200 €      | Applicants from other countries classified as Upper-middle-income economies or lower based on World Bank country rating by income | 8 |

The size and number of grants may be adjusted at the discretion of the Organizing Committee, depending upon the level of funding raised and the number of applications received. Applicants will only be able to apply for one size of travel grant, and they should apply for the grant depending on their country of residence. The World Bank rating is available [online](https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/the-world-by-income-and-region.html).

Anyone applying for more than one grant will be excluded from the application process.

<h2 id="online">Online Attendance Support Grant</h2>

For those interested in attending the conference remotely but with limited internet connectivity, smaller grants will be made available to subsidise the cost of purchasing mobile data passes. The size of each grant will vary depending on the country and mobile data packages available, but it’s expected not to exceed 40€.

With an estimated 1GB per hour of streaming videos in HD quality (720p), it’s expected that a maximum of 40GB will be sufficient to cover the entire conference. Arrangements will be made with grant recipients to purchase the data packages directly or to transfer the amount needed via mobile money.

<h2 id="criteria">Criteria</h2>

In order to guarantee a transparent and fair allocation of funds, the travel grant programme uses a points system for ranking applications. Points are awarded if applicants match specific criteria. After the application phase is over, all applicants are ranked by points, and the applicants with the most points will receive funding.

Please note that the travel grant programme aims to enhance diversity at the conference. We might reserve a few programme spots for people with unique and outstanding applications. However, most programme spots will solely be determined by the point ranking.

Furthermore, once the ranking has been drawn up and the scholarships assigned based on it. The next two people for each grant size will be informed of their position. If one of the first winners communicates by April 15th 2024, that he will not be able to participate, the scholarship will be provided to the people who are in this second ranking. However, those people will receive a free online ticket to attend the conference virtually. Moreover, if they will be able to attend the conference in person, they could receive a free ticket if they provide support volunteering.

### Lighting talks abstract

The travel grant winners will be asked to present something about their experience, their mapping activities, or their community in a dedicated lighting talk session (5-minute presentation). This is not the call for participation; the call will be open, and there will be the possibility to submit talks and workshops. The dedicated lighting talks aim to involve more travel grant winners in the conference, highlighting their contributions and experiences in OSM. However, it is possible that not all the travel grant winners will be able to present in that session. So, this is not an instrument to present talks; you are invited to participate in the call for talks and workshops if you would like to present your activities.
Please provide a short abstract about what you would like to present, with a maximum length of 100 words, up to 2 points.

### Volunteering

The travel grant winners will be asked to volunteer for a time proportional to 1/3 or less of the conference length, depending on the number of other volunteers. Indicate the roles that you are confident to do: Live Video Cutting, Remote/Pre-Recorded Talk Assistant, Session Assistant and Venueless Assistant (only for remote grants). For more detailed info on the roles, see the wiki pages of volunteers for Sotm 2022: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/State_of_the_Map_2022/volunteers#Roles. No points.


<h2 id="payment">Payment</h2>
