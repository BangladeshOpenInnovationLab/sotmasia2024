Bangladesh is a country state in Southern Asia (converging with Southeast Asia), bordering the Bay of Bengal to the South, almost entirely encircled by India to the West North and East, and Myanmar to the Southeast. Although off the beaten path by virtually any measurement, Bangladesh is populated by friendly locals.

Cox's Bazar is a city, fishing port, tourism centre, and district headquarters in southeastern Bangladesh. Cox's Bazar Beach, one of the most popular tourist attractions in Bangladesh, is the longest uninterrupted natural beach in the world. Located 150 km (93 mi) south of the city of Chittagong, Cox's Bazar is also known by the name Panowa, which translates literally as "yellow flower." An old name was "Palongkee". Kutupalong refugee camp, the world's largest refugee camp, is in Cox's Bazar.

The city covers an area of 23.4 km2 (9.0 sq mi) with 58 mahallas and 27 wards and as of 2022 had a population of nearly 200,000.[5] Cox's Bazar is connected by road and air with Chittagong.

The modern Cox's Bazar derives its name from Captain Hiram Cox, an officer of the British East India Company, a Superintendent of Palongkee outpost. To commemorate his role in refugee rehabilitation work, a market was established and named after him. It is one of Bangladesh's main tourist spots.
