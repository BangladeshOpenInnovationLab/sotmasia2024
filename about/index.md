The Bangladesh Open Innovation Lab (BOIL) and OpenStreetMap Bangladesh (OSMBD) are teaming up to host the "State of the Map Bangladesh (SoTMBD) ‘2024" conference, a first of its kind in Bangladesh, a national gathering focused on mapping and geospatial technology. It aims to gather all significant stakeholders, including IM professionals, NGOs, government counterparts, industry leaders, academic experts, and geospatial enthusiasts from across the nation and the globe. This inaugural event aligns with the broader "State of the Map (SoTM)" event series facilitated by the OpenStreetMap Foundation, reflecting a global effort to enhance open mapping initiatives. Additionally, SoTMBD will be integrated into the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team's (HOT) Opensummit program, emphasizing its role in fostering collaboration and sharing knowledge in the geospatial community.

Set against the breathtaking backdrop of Cox's Bazar, the longest natural sandy sea beach in the world, the extraordinary event is set to unfold that promises to captivate and inspire. Scheduled for September 2024, this unique gathering aims to unite a diverse array of participants for a celebration of community and cooperation. The tranquil and scenic beach view will be an ideal location for an event aimed at promoting connections and creating enduring memories. Cox's Bazar, known for its breathtaking views and lively local culture, not only serves as a location but also provides an engaging experience that enhances the atmosphere and appeal of the event. The organizers are carefully curating a program that will not only leverage the scenic beauty of the area but also underscore a commitment to inclusivity and engagement. Whether you are a local resident or a visitor from afar, this event promises an enriching experience that showcases the best of what Cox's Bazar and Bangladesh have to offer.

Participants can expect a diverse range of activities, including workshops, keynote speeches, and panel discussions aimed at fostering a deeper understanding of open-source mapping tools and their applications in addressing real-world problems. The conference will also emphasize local developments in geospatial technology and how these can be integrated with global networks to improve the quality and accessibility of map data in a regional and global context.  Whether you're a professional geographer, an information management professional, a developer, an academic, or simply someone passionate about digital collaboration, frontier technologies, and community development, SotMBD offers a unique opportunity to network, learn, and contribute to shaping the future of the geospatial industry in Bangladesh. Prepare to be inspired by keynote speeches from leading figures in the geospatial field, and don't miss the chance to contribute your own insights in interactive sessions and panel discussions. With a focus on the practical, innovative, and transformative uses of data-driven evidential frameworks, geospatial & non-geospatial data-backed solutions, open mapping ecosystems, and, of course, OpenStreetMap in addressing local challenges, this event is not just a conference—it will be a community builder, a place for growth, and a forum for change.


Overall, SotMBD will act as a catalyst for innovation and collaboration, crucial for realizing the Smart Bangladesh 2041 vision by leveraging technology to address national challenges and enhance the quality of life for its citizens, while at the same time promising to be a trendsetter in the regional & global context.


We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and conference-related social events.
